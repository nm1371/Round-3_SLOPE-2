Round-1_SLOPE-2 code is associated to find  a feasible solution of the underdetermind linear system equations with bounded variables, that is,
argmin    ⁡∑t_i 
 s.t.     t_i≥0,                          i=1,…,n,
          Sv=0,   
          || [V_(i,1),…,V_(i,d)]||_2≤t_i, ,             i=1,…,n,
          L≤V≤U.

Please set your file name, your sheet and your data range for matrix S on lines 5-7.
Please set  your data range for lower bound matrix L on the line 17.
Please set  your data range for lower bound matrix U on the line 25.
